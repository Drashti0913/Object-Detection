# Object Detection with YOLOv5

## Project Overview
This project is focused on implementing YOLOv5 for object detection tasks. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that is known for its speed and accuracy. This project utilizes pre-trained YOLOv5 models to detect objects in various environments.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Drashti0913/Object-Detection
   cd Object-Detection
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run object detection on your images, use the following command:
```
python detect.py --source <path_to_your_image>
```
Replace `<path_to_your_image>` with the path to the image you want to process.

## Results
The object detection model can identify multiple objects in a single frame. Below are some examples of the model's output where objects are highlighted using bounding boxes.
